Opendrop MVP Framework
======================

There are five main components of the MVP framework:
 - `Model`
 - `Presenter`
 - `View`
 - `IView`
 - `Application`

Broad Overview
--------------

`Model` is used to store and retrieve data, and give the `Presenter`
access to other services of the program unrelated to the user interface.

`Presenter` handles user input and transforms them to an appropriate
data format to be used with the services in `Model`. It then takes
outputs from `Model` and sends it to the `View` for presentation.

`View` is responsible for the displaying of information and
forwarding user input to the `Presenter`. It does this by exposing
methods and events that the `Presenter` can call and connect to.

`IView` is the `View`'s interface that the `Presenter` has a
dependency with. It specifies the methods and attributes that the `View`
should implement.

`Application` manages the lifecycle of `View`s and `Presenter`s, as well
as the wiring of dependencies for both objects.

**More Details:**

Each `Presenter` has a reference to one `Model` and one `View`, neither
`Model` nor `View` has a reference to the `Presenter`.

The `Model`, `IView`, and `Presenter` classes should be independent to
the GUI library used for the user interface; instead, this should be in
the `View` class.

View/Presenter Lifecycle
------------------------

In a `View`/`Presenter` pair, the `View` is first initialised, followed
by the `Presenter`, which is passed the `Model` and `View` objects as
arguments to the constructor. The `Model` object is created at the start
of the application and is shared among all the `Presenter` objects.

When a `Presenter` and `View` is first created, their `setup()` methods
are called. `View`s are the first to be initialised, and so
`Presenter.setup()` is always called after `View.setup()`.

When a `View` is destroyed, its `teardown()` method is called. Its
`Presenter` is then subsequently destroyed and its `teardown()` method
is called as well.

The `Presenter` is never destroyed directly, the `View` is always the
object that is destroyed. `Presenter` has a handler that connects to the
`View`'s destroy event, the handler will then call the private destroy
method on the `Presenter` whenever the `View` is destroyed.

How to use
----------

The `Application`, `Model`, `IView`, `IView` and `Presenter` classes are
intended to be subclassed.

As the `Application` and `View` classes do
not provide any implementation of GUI libraries, they should be
subclassed into, for example, `GtkApplication` and `GtkView`, and your
actual implementations should further subclass those (see the sample
application).

Subclassing `Presenter` is as follows:

    MyPresenter(Presenter[MyModel, IMyView]):
        pass

Where `MyModel` is an implementation of `Model` and `IMyView` is the
interface for the view that `MyPresenter` presents.

To handle view events, use the `@handles` decorator, imported from
`opendrop.mvp`:

    MyPresenter(Presenter[MyModel, IMyView]):
        @handles('on_event0')
        def handle_event0(self):
            pass

The `@handles` decorator will mark a method as an event handler and such
methods are automatically connected to the view events during the
initialisation fo the presenter.

Subclassing `Application`:

    SampleApplication(Application):
        MODEL = MyModel
        VIEWS = [MyView, OtherView, CoolView]
        PRESENTERS = [MyPresenter, OtherPresenter, CoolPresenter]

        ENTRY_VIEW = MyView

`MODEL` specifies the `Model` class object that will be used by the
application's presenters.

`VIEWS` specifies the list of views your application contains.

`PRESENTERS` likewise specifies the list of presenters that your
application uses.

`ENTRY_VIEW` is the first view that the application begins with.

In your application, each presenter may be capable of presenting more
than one view, but each view must have only one presenter that can
present it.

`Application` pairs up each `View` to its corresponding `Presenter` by
going through the `PRESENTERS` list and checking
`Presenter.can_present(View)`, if this returns `True` then the presenter
is selected for use.
